Working Title: CoolDrive

This project uses Unity 2018.2.6f1

This is currently a work in progress. I still need to work on balancing issues, as well as implement some game mechanics and a few more special abilities. Really, it's just proof of concept right now.

Currently, you can drive around a test track without any real goals, but that will change in the next build. 
You can drive with WASD, and pressing left shift will give you a quick burst of speed, though it won't break the already implemented speed cap just yet. 
Catch air by jumping off of ramps, and cool your engine down. The consequences aren't implemented yet (I need to figure out how to respawn a player in a scene), 
but they will be! Run your engine too hot and you'll be liable to explode, though if it gets too cold you'll slow to a crawl, and also explode for reasons that haven't been decided yet.

Planned features: 
-Heat generation determined by environment. (You'll need to boost in colder weather if you want to survive!)
-An ability to increase downforce but also increase engine temp at a greater rate than normal.
-Ability to rotate your car in midair, and adding a trick system to take advantage of this.(think Tony Hawk's Pro Skater)
-Give less cooling for poorly done tricks or landings
-More track pieces
-Physics effects for boosting applied to other objects too? (see: pursuing cars)
